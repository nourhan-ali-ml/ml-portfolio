# Predictive Maintenance System for Medical Devices

## 📌 Overview
This project is an end-to-end **AI-powered Predictive Maintenance system** designed to predict failure risks for medical devices based on operational and environmental logs.

The system simulates a real-world production setup, including:
- Machine Learning model training
- REST API for inference
- Prediction logging
- Interactive monitoring dashboard

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Unexpected failures in medical devices can cause:
- Equipment downtime
- Increased maintenance costs
- Potential patient safety risks

The goal is to **predict maintenance needs early** using device usage logs and sensor data.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach

### 1️⃣ Machine Learning
- Model: **Random Forest Classifier**
- Features:
  - Device type
  - Usage hours
  - Temperature
  - Error count
- Outputs:
  - `maintenance_needed` (binary)
  - `risk_probability` (confidence score)

---

### 2️⃣ Backend API
Built using **FastAPI** with the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `/health` | Health check |
| `/predict` | Predict maintenance risk |
| `/logs` | View prediction history |

All predictions are logged for monitoring and analysis.

---

### 3️⃣ Monitoring Dashboard
- Interactive plots using Plotly
- Filter by device type
- Visualize risk distribution and trends
- Designed to simulate real production monitoring
